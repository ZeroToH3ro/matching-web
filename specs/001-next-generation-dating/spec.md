## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A privacy-conscious single person wants to find meaningful romantic connections without sacrificing control over their personal data or being manipulated by opaque algorithms. They create an authentic, evolving profile, discover compatible matches through fair systems, and build relationships gradually through meaningful interactions while maintaining full ownership of their photos and personal information.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user wants to join the platform, **When** they complete onboarding, **Then** they maintain full control over their data privacy settings and can create a rich profile without technical friction
2. **Given** a user has created their profile, **When** they browse potential matches, **Then** they see authentic profiles through an unbiased discovery system with sub-second response times
3. **Given** two users are interested in each other, **When** they begin communicating, **Then** they can share photos/videos with granular permission controls and engage through meaningful gestures beyond simple likes
4. **Given** a user wants to leave the platform, **When** they request account deletion, **Then** all their data and traces are completely removed from the system
5. **Given** a user wants premium features, **When** they subscribe, **Then** they receive genuine value that enhances their experience without creating unfair advantages over free users

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to share inappropriate content through the photo/video system?
- How does the system handle users attempting to create fake or misleading profiles?
- What occurs when matching algorithms detect suspicious behavior patterns?
- How does the platform respond when users report harassment or inappropriate behavior?
- What happens if a user's privacy preferences conflict with matching requirements?
