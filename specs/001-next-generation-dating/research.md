**Branch**: `001-next-generation-dating` | **Date**: 2025-09-24

## Technology Research Summary

This document consolidates research findings for implementing a next-generation dating platform using Sui blockchain and Web3 technologies.

## 1. Sui Blockchain Development Patterns

### Decision: Sui blockchain as primary infrastructure
**Rationale**: Sui's object-oriented architecture, parallel execution (297,000+ TPS), and Web2-like UX capabilities make it ideal for social applications requiring high throughput and low latency interactions.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Ethereum: Rejected due to high gas fees and slow confirmation times
- Solana: Rejected due to network stability concerns and less predictable fees
- Polygon: Rejected due to dependency on Ethereum's limitations

### Implementation approach:
- Object-oriented design for user profiles, matches, and messages as Sui objects
- Parallel transaction processing for simultaneous user interactions
- Programmable transaction blocks for atomic operations (like, match, message)
- Dynamic NFT profiles that evolve based on user interactions

## 2. Nautilus Zero Knowledge Integration

### Decision: Nautilus TEE for confidential matching algorithms
**Rationale**: Provides trusted execution environments with ZK proofs for privacy-preserving matching without revealing user preferences, ensuring GDPR/CCPA compliance.

**Alternatives considered**:
- On-chain computation: Rejected - too expensive and not private
- Centralized matching: Rejected - trust issues and single point of failure
- Homomorphic encryption: Rejected - performance limitations

### Implementation approach:
- AWS Nitro Enclaves for production reliability
- Cryptographic attestation verification in smart contracts
- Off-chain computation for complex compatibility algorithms
- ZK proofs for verifiable confidential matching

## 3. Walrus Protocol for Media Storage

### Decision: Walrus for decentralized media storage
**Rationale**: 100x cheaper than traditional cloud storage, erasure coding redundancy, native Sui integration, and handles large multimedia files efficiently.

**Alternatives considered**:
- IPFS: Rejected - complex pinning and availability issues
- Centralized storage: Rejected - single point of failure, high costs
- Arweave: Rejected - higher costs for frequently accessed data

### Implementation approach:
- 4x replication redundancy for durability
- Encryption and access control integration
- Progressive image loading for better UX
- Media compression before storage

## 4. Seal Protocol for Access Control

### Decision: Seal for subscription and permission management
**Rationale**: Enables sophisticated decentralized access control with threshold encryption, smart contract-based rules, and flexible monetization models.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Traditional auth systems: Rejected - centralized control
- Basic smart contract permissions: Rejected - limited flexibility
- Multi-sig approaches: Rejected - complex management overhead

### Implementation approach:
- Threshold encryption prevents single points of failure
- Granular permission systems with time-based controls
- Envelope encryption for key rotation
- Clear access policy hierarchies

## 5. zkLogin Implementation

### Decision: zkLogin for seamless Web3 onboarding
**Rationale**: Eliminates Web3 barriers by using familiar OAuth providers while maintaining privacy through zero-knowledge proofs, dramatically improving user adoption.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Traditional wallet connections: Rejected - high user friction
- Email/password auth: Rejected - centralized control
- Social logins without ZK: Rejected - privacy concerns

### Implementation approach:
- Support multiple OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, Apple)
- Secure salt generation and storage
- Clear privacy explanations to users
- Graceful fallbacks for ZK proof failures

---

## 6. Move Smart Contract Architecture

### Decision: Move contracts for core dating platform logic
**Rationale**: Move's object-oriented model, ownership system, and resource-based programming prevent common vulnerabilities while enabling efficient relationship modeling.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Solidity: Rejected - more vulnerable to common attacks
- Rust-based contracts: Rejected - less optimized for asset management
- Traditional databases: Rejected - centralization concerns

### Implementation approach:
- Clear object ownership hierarchies
- Capabilities for access control
- Event emission for off-chain indexing
- Planned upgrade strategies from deployment

---

## 7. Privacy-Preserving Matching Algorithms

### Decision: ZK proofs for compatibility scoring
**Rationale**: Enables private recommendation systems without revealing user preferences, ensuring regulatory compliance while maintaining matching effectiveness.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Homomorphic encryption: Rejected - performance limitations
- Secure multi-party computation: Rejected - complex infrastructure
- Trusted third parties: Rejected - centralization risks

### Implementation approach:
- Optimized circuits for mobile proof generation
- Recursive proofs for complex matching logic
- Efficient verification in Move contracts
- Privacy-preserving incentive mechanisms

---

## 8. SuiNS for User Experience

### Decision: SuiNS integration for human-readable addresses
**Rationale**: Simplifies gifting and social interactions with memorable names, eliminating complex address management for non-technical users.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Address copying: Rejected - poor user experience
- Centralized usernames: Rejected - platform lock-in
- ENS: Rejected - not native to Sui ecosystem

### Implementation approach:
- Name resolution caching for performance
- Support for both .sui and .move domains
- Gifting UI built around human-readable names
- Reverse resolution for sender identification

---

## 9. Native Randomness Integration

### Decision: Sui native VRF for surprise features
**Rationale**: Provides truly random, verifiable, and tamper-proof random number generation without external oracle costs or complexity.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Chainlink VRF: Rejected - additional costs and complexity
- Pseudo-random generation: Rejected - predictable and gameable
- Off-chain randomness: Rejected - trust and verification issues

### Implementation approach:
- Native VRF for surprise matching features
- Request-fulfillment patterns for expensive operations
- UI handling for randomness delays
- Combination with user preferences for better matching

---

## 10. Sponsored Transactions

### Decision: Platform-sponsored transactions for Web2 UX
**Rationale**: Eliminates gas fee barriers, enables seamless onboarding, improves conversion rates, and supports freemium business models.

**Alternatives considered**:
- User-paid gas: Rejected - high friction for Web2 users
- Meta-transactions: Rejected - complex infrastructure requirements
- Payment channels: Rejected - implementation complexity

### Implementation approach:
- Tiered sponsorship (free/premium users)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Dynamic cost monitoring and limit adjustments
- Clear upgrade paths to premium features
